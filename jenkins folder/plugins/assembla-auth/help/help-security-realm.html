 Authentication requires a valid OAuth application to be registered with http://www.assembla.com.
 <br/>
 Using your Assembla account you can create a new application registration using this link:
  <a href="https://www.assembla.com/user/edit/manage_clients">https://www.assembla.com/user/edit/manage_clients</a>
  <br/>
  
Registered oAuth application ID/Secret will be visible only for user who created it.
<br/>

The entry should look like this:

<table>
<tr><th>Name</th><td>You can set any name you want. </td></tr>
<tr><th>Website</th><td>http://127.0.0.1:8080</td></tr>
<tr><th>Redirect URI</th><td>http://127.0.0.1:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin</td></tr>
</table>

With <b>127.0.0.1:8080</b> replaced with the public hostname and port of your Jenkins instance.
<p/>
 The <b>/securityRealm/finishLogin</b> is required as this is where Assembla will redirect the user for the second part of the authorization process.
