<div>
    Plugin functionality of build combinations that you want to <b>deploy</b> through a Groovy expression that returns
    true or false.

    <p>
        When you specify a Groovy expression here, only the build combinations that result in <b>true</b>
        will be influence by the Artifactory plugin deploy functionality. In evaluating the expression, multi
        configuration axes are exposed
        as variables
        (with their values set to the current combination evaluated).
    </p>
    The Groovy expression is in the same syntax like in <b>Combination Filter</b> under <b>Configuration Matrix</b>
